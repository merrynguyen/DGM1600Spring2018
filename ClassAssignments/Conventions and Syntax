Conventions are rules that are made in C# so that the readers all have the same layout and understanding of what code is in front of them 
Syntax is the language that goes into C3, for example each sentence ends with a ;.
Another convention is that you should write one line and one declaration per line
Each "box" starts and ends with {} and each call will also start and end with ()
There are boxes that can be within boxes that do a call or function. 
A class is the bigger box that can contain a lot of functions, but there can be many classes as well.
In all honesty I don't know if that makes sense but I think I am getting it.
